      Miami has earned its fair share of notoriety over the last 30 years, but most
      of it has been nothing to brag about: The Liberty City Riots, the Mariel
      Boatlift, and the Cocaine Wars of the early 1980s recast the formerly sleepy
      beach town/retirement colony as a lawless urban hellscape crowded with pimps,
      powder queens and cutthroats, where liquor-store shootouts, revenge
      bombings and police corruption threatened to drown the tourist trade in
      an ocean of blood, booze, and yayo. But now the peace-loving citizens of
      Miami finally have something they can hoist high as an enduring emblem of
      cultural and civic pride (besides KC & the Sunshine Band, Gloria Estefan
      and 2 Live Crew, obviously) …

      Enter Torche, the four-pronged Floridian Riff Colossus that has
      steamrolled its way across the international underground. Led by
      vocalist/guitarist Steve Brooks (formerly of doom dropouts Floor) and
      featuring the myriad talents of drummer Rick Smith, bassist Jonathan
      Nuñez and guitarist Juan Montoya, Torche unfurled their self-titled debut
      in 2005 via Richmond, Virginia’s Robotic Empire. The glorious half-hour
      of blissed-out power-grooves, triumphant vocal harmonies and cosmic
      resonance within was variously hailed as “stoner pop,” “thunder rock,”
      and “doom pop,” but a consensus was quickly reached within the Fourth
      Estate: Both the underground and mainstream press had their hands halfway
      down their pants just thinking about listening to Torche. The band was
      immediately lauded as giants among men, leaders among sheep, and
      powerbrokers of a deadly new sonic idiom founded upon Brooks’ signature
      “bomb-string” detonation-detune. As Decibel magazine so righteously
      pointed out in May of 2005, Torche “carries on in the dizzying Sabbathian
      tradition of Floor, only potentially more bottomless and epic.” Seven
      months later, the same publication would declare Torche as the # 7 album
      of the year in its annual top 40.

    <blockquote>
      “Never let it be said that bong-rock types hate hooks,” Spin magazine
      announced. “Torche set their guitars on ‘dirge,’ work their vocal
      harmonies, and say amen to Foo Fighters’ riff-o-matic preaching.”
    </blockquote>
    
    
    <blockquote>
      “At long last, we know what life would be like in a parallel universe
      where the Melvins became a pop sensation instead of Nirvana,” Revolver
      magazine added.
    </blockquote>

      With the verdicts in, Torche swiftly set out to slay, punish & conquer.
      Stateside tours with Scottish post-rock marvels Mogwai and hypno-metal
      heroes Isis ensued, as did a European invasion with Savannah sludge
      captains Baroness. “[Torche’s] debut jaunt to the UK will undoubtedly
      leave a monumental impression on the audiences they have played for as
      they mix the pop-tinged catchiness of tracks such as ‘In Return’ and
      ‘Erase’ with the likes of ‘Iron Girl’ and boil it down to a cocktail of
      raw and powerful sludge-filled beauty,” Terrorizer magazine gushed after
      witnessing the band’s show at the Manchester Attic. Rock Sound issued
      similar proclamations after the London Underworld show: “Louder than a
      really loud thing, Torche hit the stage with all the grace and subtlety
      of a misfired nuclear warhead. Sounding far fiercer than on record, the
      Florida outfit’s ‘bomb-string’ assault is truly a thing to behold.”

    <p>
      So: Citizens of Miami, rejoice. Music fans, exult. Torche are about to
      rule your stereo and your face all over again.
